        <h1>Ray Tracing</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
        For my final project, I implemented a ray tracer in <a
            href="https://golang.org">go</a>, that can simulate light
        hitting an object, reflecting off the object, and refracting
        through the object. The ray tracer reads from a povray input file
        specified on the command line. I only support the lighting
        components (diffuse, ambient, specular, roughness), reflection,
        refraction, and index of refraction properties within the povray
        file. The ray tracer will also run the initial casts in parallel
        using either the number of cores on your machine, or the value of
        the environment variable GOMAXPROCS to determine how many threads
        to spawn.
        </p>
        <h2>Basic Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
        The basic steps I followed to cast a scene are as follows:
        <ol>
            <li>Store all the objects that will be in your scene into a
                buffer</li>
            <li>Calculate a view plane based on your camera's position, up
                vector, right vector, and look_at point</li>
            <li>For each point in the view plane, cast a ray from your
                camera through the point, and write the color of the
                intersected object to your image</li>
        </ol>
        The casting also required a basic algorithm:
        <ol>
            <li> Start with an initial ray given to you, go through your
                buffer of saved objects, and find which object the ray will
                intersect first, if any</li>
            <li> Test for ray intersection
                <ol>
                    <li> If ray doesn't intersect any objects, return predetermined
                        background color</li>
                    <li> If ray does intersect an object, save the point of
                        intersection and which object was hit</li>
                </ol> 
            </li>
            <li> Assuming there was an intersection, calculate the current
                pixel's color with phong shading of the intersection point
                using the objects diffuse, ambient, specular, and 1/roughness
                values</li>
            <li> If the object's reflection coefficient is greater than 0, then
                calculate the reflected color:
                <ol>
                    <li> Calculate the reflected ray starting at the
                        intersection point, and traveling away at the same angle to
                        the normal as the incoming ray was</li>
                    <li> Determine the reflected ray's color by casting your
                        reflection ray using the same algorithm as your global
                        casting</li> 
                    <li> If your reflected ray hit anything, then multiply your
                        reflected ray's color by the object's reflection
                        coefficient, and add it to the current calculated pixel
                        color</li>
                </ol>
            </li> 
            <li> If the object's refraction coefficient is greater than 0, then
                calculate the refracted color: 
                <ol>
                    <li> Calculate the refracted ray by starting at the
                        intersection point and calculating the ray's direction
                        using the object's index of refraction and the equation: 
                        n1 * sin(&Theta;1) = n2 * sin(&Theta;2), where n
                        represents the index of refraction. I assumed the
                        non-object was air with an index of refraction of 1.0 </li>
                    <li> Determine the refracted ray's color by casting the
                        refracted ray using the same algorithm as the global
                        cast</li>
                    <li> If your refracted ray hit anything, then multiply your
                        refracted ray's color by the object's refraction
                        coefficient, and add it to the current calculated pixel
                        color</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li> Finally, if the computed pixel's color had an alpha component
                less than 1, I needed to get the color of the object behind it,
                if one exists. I accomplished this by ray casting (again!) with
                the current object being ignored in the buffer of objects. Then
                multiply the returned color by 1 - (computed pixel's
                color).alpha and add it to the computed pixel's color</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>Parallelization</h2>
        <p>
            In order to parallelize the ray caster, I utilized go's goroutines
            and channels. A goroutine can either be a new thread or process
            that will run the given function, depending on what the program
            sets up. A channel in go is essentially a pipe that allows
            goroutines to communicate with one another in either a synchronous
            or asynchronous manner. I set up the program to use goroutines as
            threads, and created an asynchronous channel that the main
            goroutine will write into and the child goroutines will read from.
            I decided to parallelize this program by creating a number of
            threads and having them read in the pixels that needed to be cast,
            and cast them, writing the returned color into an image data
            struct. This allows multiple rays to be initially cast in parallel,
            however any recursive casting will still be done serially.
